==================

(To-do; Update Readme!)

A simple console application which allows to connect via adb to an android device and send via "adb input keyevents <id>" different inputs.

Keys that are mapped:

Enter -> Enter/Select

Backspace -> Back

Escape -> Menu

A-Z + 1-0 -> Normal Keyboard Keys

Comma -> ,

Period -> .

F5, F6, F7 -> Volume Keys (Mute, volume down, volume up respectively)

F5 -> Back to Menu


This is not a remote for everyday usage, since its very slow (adb). I just made this small program, because I forgot my Amazon Fire TV Remote, when I was at my girlfriends house.
